          <h3><b>Extrinsic v Intrinsic Rewards</b></h3>
          <p>Broadly, there are two types of "rewards" or reasons teachers are teachers: Extrinsic, aka external rewards, and instrinic, or internal rewards</p>
          <ul>
            <b>Extrinsic</b>
            <li>Salary</li>
            <li>Higher status (everyone needs to be taught, and teaching is very noble)</li>
            <li>Power</li>
            <li>Work Schedule (summer's off!)</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <b>Intrinsic</b>
            <li>Enjoyable profession / teaching in of itself</li>
            <li>Teaching is for the better good</li>
            <li>Knowing other teachers</li>
            <li>Joy of the process</li>

      <h3><b>School v Education</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <h5>How do education and school relate?</h5>
      <p>Education is an ever-changing, active, random process. Everything you do teaches you something</p>
      <p>Schools are places intended to systematize this process. Schools are passive, preplanned experiences to teach you the basics needed in life and work.</p>

      <h5>What are some parts of a school?</h5>
      <p>Schools are much more than the learning. Schools have entire cultures, aka beliefs, ideas, stories, art, habits, organization, language, and more!</p>
      <p>A school culture can be positive or negative, and it's very important for school officials to work to better the culture. This is based in every interaction between student and staff.</p>
      <p>School cultures typically try to meet a goal, laid out by the Mission statement. Almost every school has one, and even businesses or organizations often have them.</p>

            <p>If a school has a culture, so does a classroom. These environs are set up by the type of teacher one is. One way to catogorize teachers is through what type of reconstructionist they are</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Social Reconstructioniss</b> believe in empowering students to be agents of change.</li>
              <li><b>Democratic Reconstructioniss</b> believe in setting the responcibility of the students to solve the issues of the world. </li>
              <li><b>Economic Reconstructioniss</b> believe in a harder view of the dominent culture and see schools has servants to those in power, and wish to change that</li>
